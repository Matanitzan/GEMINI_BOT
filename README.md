# Gemini Bot (Python)

A minimal Python script that sends a single message to Google's Gemini API and prints the model's response.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Clone the repo and navigate to the folder**
2. **Create a `.env` file** with your Gemini API key:
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here

3. **Install dependencies** (you can use a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

Note for macOS users:
Hebrew text may appear reversed in the terminal due to RTL display issues.
If that happens, just copy the response and paste it into a text editor â€” it will display correctly.
